# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```



 npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/stakingContract.js --network neondevnet
[dotenv@17.2.0] injecting env (3) from .env (tip: ⚙️  specify custom .env file path with { path: '/custom/path/.env' })
✔ Confirm deploy to network neondevnet (245022926)? … yes
